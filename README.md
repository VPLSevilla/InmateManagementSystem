# InmateManagementSystem
A system used to manage inmate information such as health condition, cell location, sentence length, and type of sentence

Notes:
The system lacks a checker to see if an inmate already has the same sentence when moving them to solitary, resulting in multiple instances of the same inmate put in solitary.

The Cancle Button does not work as I forgot to put a function to it.
